## Gaussian Process Regression for ground-water pollution prediction
<img align="right" height="160" src="https://github.com/ivanalberico/probabilisticAI_projects/blob/main/images/GaussianProcessRegression.png"></img>
Implementation of a Gaussian Process regression applied on a real world inference problem (ground-water pollution prediction). Nystr√∂m approximation of the kernel function and inducing points method were applied to cope with the computational burden of the problem, due to the very large dataset.

Implementation of a Bayesian Optimization algorithm that performs hyperparameter tuning with constraints. Expected Improvement (EI) and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) activation functions were both deployed to implement the algorithm.

## Actor Critic Reinforcement Learning (LunarLander-v2 OpenAI Gym)
<img align="right" height="130" src="https://github.com/ivanalberico/probabilisticAI_projects/blob/main/images/ReinforcementLearning.png"></img>
Implementation of a Deep Reinforcement Learning algorithm able to learn a control policy for a lander (spaceship), by practicing on a simulator. The project required the use of Actor-Critic methods with policy gradients, in particular Rewards-to-go and Generalized Advantage Estimatation methods, both aiming at decreasing the variance of the policy gradient estimates.
